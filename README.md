# AI- Research Project

Abstract: Final Artificial Intelligence project focuses on classification task of abalone dataset based on the sex. Predicting the age of abalone from its physical measurements is important as the economic value of is positively correlated with its age. It is therefore very crucial to detect the age of abalone accurately for both farmers and customers to determine its price. It is quite rare as it does not grow in every part of the world shorelines and handpicking them in the sea makes it expensive. The research project applies several machine learning algorithms to enhance Abalone classification using Pycaret open-source library. Results from various models show that Gradient Boosting Classifier provides the best performance.
